### Team vision

To change government to serve people better, all major departments will:
* conduct design research that informs key services (and related policy) monthly,
* in a robust, deliberate, and ethical way,
* that results in changes to service delivery and governing policy.

This vision guides the objectives we set and key decisions we make.

### Objectives

Each quarter we (like all teams at CDS) set objectives and key results (or OKRs). 
Objectives are overarching goals. Key results are concrete manifestations of each objective. Read more about the [origin of OKRs from Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/).

#### Current quarter objectives

* Lead research that surfaces the needs of all users, including people whose primary language is French and people who have disabilities.
* Increasing user research capabilities of CDS & Partners to take collective accountability for improving user experience of services.
* Ensure key product development decisions are grounded in research.
* Prepare our research operation to meet the needs of several new product teams.

We note progress on key results weekly and score them monthly. Watch our progress in the [quarter 4 OKR progress tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PHSA14FN6d0l-RfceFHuUY7JDmPaAID17Mtz011gJUU/edit#gid=0).

#### Previous quarter objectives

* [Quarter 3, October to December 2018 objectives and key results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QGrOZp2jPIUoVto3vz-5iyKvZxQWmhEft-LkYE9MUBI/edit)

#### How we set objectives quarterly

1. At the end of each quarter, we have a team retreat where:
 * we score the last quarter's objectives and key results. As a team, we give each key result a score between 0 and 1.
 * we reflect on (or "retro") the last quarter.
 * team members propose possible objectives for the coming quarter and we vote on them.
 * assign a "lead" to each of our objectives
2. Each objective lead then drafts a set of key results for that objective. They work with Colin and the team to get feedback and objectives. 
3. Then, the whole team meets with Aaron (chief executive officer) and Ross (head of delivery). We review last quarter's scores and this quarter's feedback.
4. Colin then loads up an OKR tracking spreadsheet [like this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PHSA14FN6d0l-RfceFHuUY7JDmPaAID17Mtz011gJUU/edit#gid=0) for us to track progress.
