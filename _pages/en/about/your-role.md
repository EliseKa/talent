Our job advertisement is an honest description of what we hope you'll do:

*   You conduct compelling research that drives product decisions. You lead discovery interviews, observation, and analysis of existing data. You scope research plans that will lead to both short-term and long-term successes. 
*   You bring users' voices and perspectives into the service conversation. You choose research methods that elicit the users' contexts and lived experiences. 
*   You plan and conduct research in an agile environment.
*   You champion user research as a key part of the product development process for our partners. You present research to skeptical audiences. You can help partners build their own research capabilities.
*   You reflect on your research practice. You think about what could make your research more useful, ethical, and efficient. You're also always thinking about how to improve our products and our processes.
*   You bring fresh opinions. You're willing to challenge your product team's assumptions. You speak openly to best represent the users. 

In practice, this means you:

* Serve as the researcher on the product team and provide them the data they need to make good decisions.
* Contribute to tools and teaching that advance our research practice as a whole.
* Gather and accept feedback on your work from your peers (within and outside our community).
* Continue to develop your own skills. Attend training and present at [community meetings]({{site.baseurl}}/team-meetings).
