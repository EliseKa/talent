### What we do

The Talent team makes Human Resources (HR) stuff easy and intuitive for the CDS team. Our team is focused on providing an amazing experience to past, present and future CDS team members. We bring a data-driven and people centred approach to HR. We do this by:

- Creating tools to help assess & hire candidates that strike a balance meeting our legal requirements and candidate experience. 
- Managing the consistency and quality of the hiring process.
- Acting as the culture champion including leading the culture pulse survey quarterly and building action plans for improvement.
- Running programs and learning events that enhance the employee experience.
- Ensuring we’re building repeatable & scalable processes.
