Design research helps build services that meet human needs. 

### Who we are
* Colin MacArthur (head of design research)
* Mithula Naik (senior design researcher)
* Antoine Garcia-Suarez (design researcher)
* Hillary Lorimer (design researcher)
* Martha Edwards (design researcher)
* Mel Banyard (design researcher)

### What we do
We help product teams identify user needs that inform design and development.
We do that by:
- Planning research activities that bring clarify to the goals and problems at hand.
- Conducting field research with end users, while bringing the team along for the journey.
- Analyzing & synthesizing data, telling the story of people who use our services.
- Evaluating & testing product improvements, helping our products continue to approve.
When we do all those things well, we help our teams build products that serve people better.

### How we work with others

#### Policy
Policy helps us navigate rules that affect research (like privacy and POR regulations). They also help us understand the background and rationale for our products.

#### Design
Designers and researchers are two peas in a pod. Designers are our co-researchers. Researchers are their co-designers. Research informs designer's work. We discuss ideas together. And researchers help evaluate what gets built.

#### Engineering and product
Engineers and product managers come along for research and use our findings. At CDS, they're key partners in research.

#### Outreach
We work with our outreach team to tell the story of how research happens and who we help.

### How we need other teams to help

**Build things based on research, not your (or our partners') assumptions.**

- Partners may not know why we do user research. Work alongside your researcher to prove the value to them.
- Fight to make sure you have a researcher on your team.
- Question why we're prioritizing things that aren't backed by research.

**Get out of the office and talk to the people we serve, early and often.**

Nothing is more powerful than being in the field and listening to the end user tell you about their needs. Or how we aren't meeting them.

**Be a research champion. Involve yourself in research and improve your research skills.**

- Attend the bi-weekly research community meetings. 
- Hang out with us. Letâ€™s get coffee. :)
